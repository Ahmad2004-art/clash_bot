 🚧 AI / Deep Learning Roadmap (Planned)

This project is designed to evolve into a **Deep Learning–powered autonomous agent**.

Planned AI capabilities include:
- Using **CNN-based models** to recognize game elements dynamically
- Detecting resources, buildings, enemies, and states
- Making strategic decisions instead of fixed rules
- Performing **multiple in-game tasks beyond wall upgrades**
- Simulating **human-like gameplay behavior**
- Fully autonomous play without direct human input

> ⚠️ The current version uses automation and image detection.  
> Deep Learning integration is **planned for future versions**.

🤖 Clash Bot — Autonomous Game Automation System

An advanced **Python automation bot** designed to automatically **upgrade walls in Clash of Clans** by interacting with the game UI on Windows.  
This project is my **main automation project** and is being developed as a foundation for a future **AI-driven autonomous game agent**.

---

 🎯 Project Vision

The initial goal of this bot is to **fully automate the wall upgrade process**, removing repetitive manual work.

The long-term vision is far more ambitious:

> To build an **AI-powered system capable of playing the game autonomously**,  
> making decisions similarly to a human player — **without human interaction**.

## 🚀 Current Features (Automation Phase)

- Automatic game launch via Windows shortcut
- Screen-based image detection for walls and UI elements
- Mouse and keyboard automation
- Timed action loops for continuous upgrading
- Stable execution for long-running sessions

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Current)

- **Language:** Python  
- **Automation & Vision:** PyAutoGUI  
- **OS:** Windows  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Current Version)

- Captures screenshots of the game screen
- Detects walls and buttons using image matching
- Executes upgrade actions automatically
- Uses rule-based logic (non–machine learning)
