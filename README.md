  Project Overview

Clash Bot automates repetitive in-game actions by simulating **keyboard, mouse, and screen interactions**.  
It is built to showcase skills in:
- Automation logic
- Event timing & control
- Screen-based interaction
- Real-world scripting challenges

This repository represents my **main automation project**.
