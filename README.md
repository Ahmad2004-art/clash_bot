🤖 Clash Bot — Autonomous Game Automation System
📌 Overview

Clash Bot is a Python-based automation system designed to automate repetitive in-game actions in Clash of Clans using screen-based image recognition and UI interaction.

The project serves as a foundational step toward developing a future AI-driven autonomous agent capable of strategic decision-making.

The current implementation focuses on automation, with long-term plans for Deep Learning integration.

🎯 Project Vision

The short-term objective is to automate repetitive UI-based tasks such as wall upgrades.

The long-term vision is to evolve this project into:

A Deep Learning–powered autonomous agent capable of analyzing game states, recognizing dynamic elements, and making strategic decisions without predefined rules.

This transforms the project from simple automation into an AI research experiment in:

Autonomous agents

Game-state recognition

Decision-making systems

🚀 Current Features (Automation Phase)

Automated game launch via Windows shortcut

Screen-based image detection for walls and UI elements

Mouse and keyboard automation

Rule-based logic for task execution

Stable long-running execution loops

🧠 System Architecture (Current Version)

Capture real-time screenshots

Detect UI elements via image matching

Apply rule-based decision logic

Execute automated input actions

The current version does not use machine learning.

🚧 AI / Deep Learning Roadmap (Planned)

The system is designed to evolve into a Deep Learning–based autonomous agent.

Planned enhancements include:

CNN-based visual recognition of game elements

Dynamic detection of resources, buildings, and enemies

Reinforcement Learning for strategic decisions

Multi-task autonomous behavior

Human-like action timing simulation

Fully autonomous play without predefined rule loops

⚠️ Current version uses rule-based automation.
AI integration is planned for future research versions.
